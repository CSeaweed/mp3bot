# Mp3 Downloader bot for Discord
* Use as you wish 

## State 
* This is quite messy rn, will fix sooner or later
* Some decisions just don't make any sense (Both OS and Pathlib being used)

## Used packages
* Pytube        For downloading the audio
* Discord.py    For making the bot

## Issues
* "get_throttling_function_name"; Wait for Pytube update or change line 272 in pytube/cipher.py to "r'a\.[a-zA-Z]\s*&&\s*\([a-z]\s*=\s*a\.get\("n"\)\)\s*&&\s*.*\|\|\s*(.*)\(',"
