# Mp3 Downloader bot for Discord
* Use as you wish 

## State 
* This is quite messy rn, will fix sooner or later
* Some decisions just don't make any sense (Both OS and Pathlib being used)

## Used packages
* Pytube        For downloading the audio
* Discord.py    For making the bot

## Issues
* 28.6, Pytube package seems to be broken due to changes at YouTube's end, waiting for a fix for now
